# Summary
A prediction for the landing outcome of the Falcon 9 first stage using Data Science methodology and Machine Learning algorithms.
SpaceX rocket launches cost about 65 million dollars while other providers cost about 165 million upwards. This is because SpaceX reuses its first stage, which is also called the booster stage. The booster returns to the earth's surface landing on either ground pads, ocean ships, or Drone ships. The project was based on previous launch data (the landing outcomes of the boosters of previous launches) from the SpaceX website and the Wikipedia page.
